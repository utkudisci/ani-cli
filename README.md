What it offers


Skins that honor anime
Swap the look at any time - each skin borrows its colors from a well known show
- Saiyan - bold orange plus blue
- Eva-01 - deep purple and heavy green
- Straw Hat - bright red but also sunny yellow
- Demon - dark green plus black
- Standard - a tidy dark sheet

Browse and search without friction
The built in scraper pulls data from the web - you see full titles, episode counts as well as crisp cover pictures in one pane.

Grab episodes inside the app
Start a download, pause it, resume it or wipe it - all files land in a folder you pick - you watch later even when offline.

History and star list
The tool logs every episode you finish. Favorite a whole series or it sticks to the top row.

Discord Rich Presence
Your Discord profile tells friends which show and episode play right now. No extra setup needed.
